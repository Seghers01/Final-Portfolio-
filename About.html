I like to hang out at local music shows/concerts, listen to music, and play guitar. I also like computers, making webpages, playing video games, and being active on social media. I play guitar in two metal bands one is called Syde FX and the other is called KingsBlade. I also like to support my local music scene and go out to shows.</p>
