  <p class="text"> Personally I would like to learn more about Java and JavaScript. JavaScript was very fun to learn but we didn't spend very much time on it, and we didn't touch regular Java at all. In my opinion Javascript was probably the funnest thing to learn in this class next to html. I would like to learn more about Java and JavaScript because of all of the fun things you can do with it like alert boxes and changing certain words or entire paragraphs into something else.</p>
